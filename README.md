"The only secure computer is one that’s unplugged, locked in a safe, and buried 20 feet under the ground in a secret location".

Greetings! I am Galina Barbascumpa, an aspiring Cybersecurity professional who is passionate about all things technology. Like many of my peers, my journey began with a fascination for understanding how systems work and a genuine love for solving complex problems. Every position in my career has required learning new technology and risk management tools. I have always loved mastering these technologies so I can troubleshoot and teach others how to use them. That same passion now drives my pursuit of a career in security risk management. 

My commitment to continuous growth fuels my pursuit of a Master of Science in Cybersecurity and Risk Management at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. In addition to this academic endeavor, I am actively working toward certifications such as CompTIA Network+ and the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate through Coursera. To reinforce my learning, I utilize Anki flashcards during study breaks and engage in hands-on labs and projects, which are displayed in my portfolio. My passion for cybersecurity is not just a career choice - it is a genuine enthusiasm that drives my ongoing development in this field. 

What excites me about cybersecurity is its dynamic nature—there's always something new to learn and challenges to overcome. I thrive on keeping my mind engaged and enjoy assisting others, whether clients or colleagues, in navigating these complexities. In my current role in Multilingual Business Intelligence, I've embraced the philosophy that 'growth and comfort do not coexist,' a mindset that drives my continuous development and commitment to excellence.

I am deeply committed to continuous growth and am eager to expand my expertise in cybersecurity. With a solid foundation of technical knowledge, a dedication to my core values, and a genuine passion for technology, I am enthusiastic about tackling new challenges. I look forward to contributing to the cybersecurity community by helping both clients and organizations enhance their security posture.
